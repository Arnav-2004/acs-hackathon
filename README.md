This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Solution

We are developing a mobile application that provides real-time access to OEM security vulnerabilities dating back to 2015, including known exploited vulnerabilities (KEVs). The application features a user-friendly dashboard with intuitive graphs and charts for easy data interpretation. Additionally, we integrate threat intelligence, allowing users to input a link and execute security assessment tools that simulate potential attacks. The system then leverages AI to analyze the results and generate actionable insights.

### Key Features:

- Live tracking of OEM vulnerabilities
- Graphical dashboard for data visualization
- Threat intelligence with AI-powered insights
- Custom API for web scraping and attack simulations

## Methodology

Data Collection -> Data Processing & Storage -> Dashboard & Visualization -> API Development & Mobile App Integration -> Threat Intelligence Integration

## Workflow

Scraping & Data Collection -> Dashboard Display -> Threat Intelligence Execution -> Continuous Updates & Alerts

## Impact

- Proactive Threat Mitigation – Organizations can identify and address risks before exploitation.
- Enhanced Cybersecurity Posture – AI-powered insights help in better decision-making.
- Simplified Vulnerability Management – A user-friendly mobile app centralizes and visualizes data.
- Faster Incident Response – Real-time data and threat intelligence allow for quick action.
- Custom API Flexibility – Integrates with existing security systems for seamless monitoring.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
